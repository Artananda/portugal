    &lt;p&gt;
        You will experience your sexuality in a completely different, mindful way, far removed from the conventional &quot;quickie.&quot; 
        You will connect deeply with yourself. 
        You will experience a space where many wonderful things can be revealed and take place.
    &lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;h2&gt;What is the &lt;strong&gt;Prana-Flow Ritual&lt;/strong&gt;?&lt;/h2&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		The Prana-Flow Ritual is based on the tantric Maithuna ritual, where Shiva and Shakti unite. 
		This is essentially a couple&#x27;s massage, an adaptation of the Maithuna ritual, where the energies are directed and released through specific massage techniques, which can lead to an elevated energetic state.
	&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		During the ritual, both partners, as in the Maithuna ritual, may sit in the Yub-Yum position and massage each other. 
		While a physical union of the partners can take place, it is not the goal of this ritual. 
		The primary aim is to activate the flow of Kundalini energy through mutual massage.
	&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		Partners alternate, with one lying down from the Yub-Yum position to receive a massage from the other. Afterward, they return to the sitting position, remaining connected with their partner. 
		It is not necessary for a physical union to occur; simply having the Lingam near the Yoni, while the partners touch each other, is sufficient to allow energy to flow. 
		An erection of the Lingam or a lubricated Yoni is not required.
	&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;b&gt;It is important to emphasize that this ritual is not focused on sexual gratification but rather on energy work and spiritual healing. As the facilitator, I merely guide the process, while the couples experience the ritual together.&lt;/b&gt;
	&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;"

    &lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Workshop&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        This workshop can, of course, also be conducted with clothing and without union, should there still be feelings of shame or other concerns.
    &lt;/p&gt;

        The workshop takes place in my studio but can also be held in your premises.

    &lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Preparation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        In preparation for this ritual, we advise the woman to allow her Yoni to be de-armored. 
        This enables energy to flow freely and enhances her ability to feel.
        Unfortunately, young girls today often misuse their bodies by skipping extended foreplay. 
        This can lead to a lack of sensitivity, which may affect their experience.&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

    	Unfortunately, many young women today do not take care of their bodies and tend to skip extended foreplay before intimacy. 
    	This can lead to a lack of sensitivity, making it difficult for them to fully experience pleasure. 
    	As a result, they may express desires that reflect a need for more intensity, which can create challenges in intimate relationships. 
    	This may lead to difficulties for some partners, as they might experience premature ejaculation, causing frustration for both parties.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;"

    &lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tantric Massage Ritual&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        In addition to the usual massage ritual, Art emphasizes tantric rituals to achieve an even deeper experience. 
        In this context, the woman embodies the goddess Shakti, while the giver takes on the role of the god Shiva. 
        There is a wonderful transfiguration ritual for this, which we will guide you through beforehand.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DeArmouring&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        You can also book DeArmouring with Art. It is also referred to as Yoni Mapping, 
        as it reconnects specific points in the Yoni with the brain, or &quot;maps&quot; them. 
        This way, even scar tissue, which can occur from an episiotomy during childbirth, 
        can be transformed into natural, receptive tissue. 
        For this, castor oil is specifically used. Please do a patch test beforehand to ensure you are not allergic to the oil.
    &lt;/p&gt;
