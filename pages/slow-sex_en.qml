    &lt;p&gt;
        You will experience your sexuality in a completely different, mindful way, far removed from the conventional &quot;quickie.&quot; &lt;/br&gt;
        You will connect deeply with yourself. &lt;/br&gt;
        You will experience a space where many wonderful things can be revealed and take place.&lt;/br&gt;

    &lt;h2&gt;What is &lt;strong&gt;Slow Sex&lt;/strong&gt;?&lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        Slow Sex refers to the union of man and woman without the customary rhythmic movements and the 
        generation of pleasure through the friction of the Lingam in the Yoni, aiming for one or more orgasms. &lt;/br&gt;
        &lt;b&gt;However, it&#x27;s important to note that this practice focuses on healing and energetic connection, rather than sexual gratification.&lt;/b&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        In Slow Sex, the Lingam moves very slowly, if at all, within the Yoni—millimeter by millimeter. 
        This is not about generating pleasure through sexual stimulation, but rather about simply being together. 
        In fact, there doesn&#x27;t even have to be a union; it is sufficient for the Lingam to simply lie in front of the Yoni so that energy can flow from the Lingam to the Yoni. The Lingam does not even have to be erect for this, which is generally advantageous for men, whether they have issues or not, as it avoids potential stress.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        This flow of energy, also called Prana or Chi, occurs from the Lingam (Yang) to the Yoni (Yin), then it continues with the woman&#x27;s inhalation to her heart (Anahata Chakra), where it is enriched with love and flows through her breasts, mouth, and tongue with her exhalation back to the heart (Anahata Chakra) of the man, where it is again enriched with love and flows with the man&#x27;s inhalation back to the Lingam, and then with the man&#x27;s exhalation back to the Yoni. 
        The energy is in a constant cycle, supporting healing, emotional connection, and balance rather than focusing on physical pleasure.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;"

    &lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Coaching&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        In a session with Art, this ritual can, of course, also take place with clothing and without union, should there still be shame or other concerns.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;"

    &lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ritual Location&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        The coaching takes place either in my studio in Wittenberg or at your home.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        Since such a session can last several hours—Diana Richardson mentions in her book &quot;Slow Sex&quot; that it can be up to 21 days—it is advisable to choose a location where you will not be disturbed.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Preparation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        In preparation for this ritual, we advise the woman to allow her Yoni to be de-armored. 
        This enables energy to flow freely and enhances her ability to feel.
        Unfortunately, young girls today often misuse their bodies by skipping extended foreplay. 
        This can lead to a lack of sensitivity, which may affect their experience.&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

    	Unfortunately, many young women today do not take care of their bodies and tend to skip extended foreplay before intimacy. 
    	This can lead to a lack of sensitivity, making it difficult for them to fully experience pleasure. 
    	As a result, they may express desires that reflect a need for more intensity, which can create challenges in intimate relationships. 
    	This may lead to difficulties for some partners, as they might experience premature ejaculation, causing frustration for both parties.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;"

    &lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tantric Ritual&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        In addition to the usual Slow Sex, Art places value on tantric rituals to achieve an even deeper experience. 
        Here, the woman steps into the role of the goddess Shakti, and the giver takes on the role of the god Shiva. 
        There is a wonderful transfiguration ritual for this, which I will introduce you to during the intake.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;"

    &lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DeArmouring&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        You can also book DeArmouring with Art. It is also referred to as Yoni Mapping, 
        as it reconnects specific points in the Yoni with the brain, or &quot;maps&quot; them. 
        This way, even scar tissue, which can occur from an episiotomy during childbirth, 
        can be transformed into natural, receptive tissue. 
        For this, castor oil is specifically used. Please do a patch test beforehand to ensure you are not allergic to the oil.
    &lt;/p&gt;
