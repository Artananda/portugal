<h2 id="basics">Basics</h2>
<p>Here I will show you the basics of sacret sexuality like Chakras, Nadis, Breathing, Kundalini, Yoga etc</p>
<div style="margin-top: 20px;"></div>
<h2 id="chakra-system">Chakra System</h2>
<p>You can read about the chakra system in any yoga or tantra book. However, what I want to share with you here is a brief explanation in the words of a layman.</p>
<p>The chakras are energy centers in or around our body. Physically, these energy centers are not manifested but exist in a subtle form – they are invisible. However, what I have learned about this system does not prevent me from believing in its existence.</p>
<p>The system essentially consists of 7 chakras, also known as chakras:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Muladhara</strong> – The root chakra is located in the perineum region, between the anus and the lingam, and points downward. This is where survival anxiety resides. When this chakra is activated, you no longer worry about survival because you know you will survive, no matter what.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Swadhistana</strong> – The sexual chakra is at the level of the lingam. It is the center of creativity. This chakra is energized through sexuality. Too much energy in this area can cause a man to ejaculate in his sleep to relieve the pressure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Manipura</strong> – In some texts, the navel chakra is also called the solar plexus chakra. It is located either at the level of the navel or the sternum. An active Manipura brings strong willpower, passion, temperament, and inner fire. If blocked, fears emerge.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Anahata</strong> – The heart chakra is located at the level of the sternum. It is the center of love, tolerance, openness, and adaptability. If blocked, one feels a lack of love and a sense of separation from the world.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Vishuddha</strong> – The throat chakra governs communication and assertiveness. When blocked, one struggles to express themselves properly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Ajna</strong> – Known as the third eye, it enables telepathic, telekinetic, and clairvoyant abilities when activated. It also houses intellect and intuition.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Sahasrara</strong> – The crown chakra is our gateway to the universe, to God, and to oneness.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="purifying-the-chakra-system">Purifying the Chakra System</h2>
<p>The chakra system should be kept clean and pure, as it allows energy to flow freely to nourish our organs. Unfortunately, chakras can be polluted by poor diet, such as eating meat, sugar, fast food, alcohol, sweetened beverages, processed foods, etc. Cigarette smoke also hinders the flow of prana because it clogs the lungs with substances like tar.</p>
<p>Watching pornography, playing war games, and consuming television and radio contribute to mental sluggishness and pollute our system. Television is often referred to as 'entertainment', but forces behind it may aim to prevent our spiritual development to keep us controllable. Once awakened, we would no longer buy unnecessary products or spend 40 hours a week in labor, as we would need far less money.</p>
<p>You can dismiss me as a conspiracy theorist if you like. However, I perceive this as reality, not theory. But we can fight back: throw away the TV, toss the radio, grow your own fruits and vegetables, avoid meat and processed foods, eliminate sugar – yes, even chocolate – quit smoking, stop drinking alcohol, and move to the countryside to escape manipulative advertising.</p>
<p>However, simply understanding the system is often enough. Once you grasp it, you can use it for your benefit.</p>
<h2 id="prana-healing-and-prana-flow-massage">Prana Healing and Prana Flow Massage</h2>
<p>If your energy system is polluted, you can undergo prana healing or enjoy a Prana Flow Massage. The latter is a method developed by a friend and me. This massage combines elements of Ayurveda, Yin-Yang, Tantra, and other massage techniques.</p>
<p>Prana is pure life energy that can flow through the body when the human being is in natural harmony. When prana flows freely, we feel vital and full of zest for life. Energetic and sexual blockages can be gently resolved with the Prana Flow Massage. Old wounds stored in the energy system may surface and dissolve. Gentle massage and targeted pressure stimulate energy points, and the released energy is spread throughout the body. Once energy flows freely, work focuses on the subtle body, often producing waves of energy that lead to intense experiences, even orgasmic sensations.</p>
<p>The massage can also serve as a gentle introduction for those who do not want intimate touches. On request, a Lingam or Yoni massage can be included to release even more energy.</p>
<h3 id="effects-of-energy-release">Effects of Energy Release</h3>
<p>• <strong>Swadhistana</strong> – This type of orgasm is familiar and not particularly extraordinary.
• <strong>Manipura</strong> – Have you ever burst into laughter during sex? This likely indicates an energy release at the Manipura chakra.
• <strong>Anahata</strong> – If you cry during sex or massage, feeling both sadness and joy, your heart chakra (Anahata) may be overflowing with prana.
• <strong>Vishuddha</strong> – I have not experienced this personally but am curious to hear your experiences. Perhaps one might start singing.
• <strong>Ajna</strong> – A woman once described seeing orgastic energy in vibrant colors after a tantric massage.
• <strong>Sahasrara</strong> – I experienced this as ecstasy, indescribable in words. I felt oneness. A colleague reported an out-of-body experience during this state.</p>
<h3 id="focusing-energy">Focusing Energy</h3>
<p>During meditation, yogis focus on their third eye (Ajna), channeling all their energy there. Similarly, in Prana Flow Massage, energy flows to where attention is focused. Touching specific points directs energy there, creating powerful and healing sensations.</p>
<p>This sacred practice demonstrates the power of focused attention and its profound effects on the human energy system.</p>
<div style="margin-top: 20px;"></div>
<h2 id="nadis">Nadis</h2>
<p>In yogic philosophy, <strong>Nadis</strong> are energy channels through which life force, or <strong>Prana</strong>, flows throughout the body. These channels are essential for maintaining physical, mental, and spiritual well-being. There are said to be <strong>72,000 nadis</strong>, but the three most significant ones are <strong>Ida</strong>, <strong>Pingala</strong>, and <strong>Sushumna</strong>, which play a crucial role in balancing and harmonizing the energy within us.</p>
<h2 id="1-ida-nadi">1. Ida Nadi</h2>
<p>The <strong>Ida Nadi</strong> is associated with the <strong>left side of the body</strong> and represents the <strong>feminine energy</strong>. It is linked to the moon (<strong>Chandra</strong>) and governs qualities like intuition, receptivity, calmness, and the subconscious mind.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Path</strong>: Ida begins at the base of the spine and flows up the left side of Sushumna, crossing over at each chakra until it reaches the left nostril.</li>
<li><strong>Element</strong>: Water</li>
<li><strong>Function</strong>: Ida regulates the parasympathetic nervous system, responsible for rest, relaxation, and recuperation.</li>
<li><strong>Imbalance</strong>: When Ida is overactive, it can lead to lethargy, depression, or excessive passivity.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="2-pingala-nadi">2. Pingala Nadi</h2>
<p>The <strong>Pingala Nadi</strong> is associated with the <strong>right side of the body</strong> and represents the <strong>masculine energy</strong>. It is linked to the sun (<strong>Surya</strong>) and governs qualities like logic, action, vitality, and the conscious mind.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Path</strong>: Pingala starts at the base of the spine and flows up the right side of Sushumna, crossing over at each chakra until it reaches the right nostril.</li>
<li><strong>Element</strong>: Fire</li>
<li><strong>Function</strong>: Pingala regulates the sympathetic nervous system, responsible for activity, alertness, and energy expenditure.</li>
<li><strong>Imbalance</strong>: When Pingala is overactive, it can lead to restlessness, aggression, or burnout.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="3-sushumna-nadi">3. Sushumna Nadi</h2>
<p>The <strong>Sushumna Nadi</strong> is the central and most important energy channel, representing the <strong>spiritual path</strong>. It is considered the bridge between Ida and Pingala and allows energy to rise from the base of the spine to the crown of the head, activating <strong>Kundalini energy</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Path</strong>: Sushumna runs straight up the center of the spine, connecting all the chakras from <strong>Muladhara</strong> (Root Chakra) to <strong>Sahasrara</strong> (Crown Chakra).</li>
<li><strong>Element</strong>: Ether (Space)</li>
<li><strong>Function</strong>: Sushumna is active when Ida and Pingala are balanced, enabling spiritual growth, heightened awareness, and a sense of oneness.</li>
<li><strong>Significance</strong>: This is the pathway through which enlightenment occurs. When Kundalini energy rises through Sushumna, it awakens all the chakras, leading to a state of transcendence.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-dance-of-ida-and-pingala">The Dance of Ida and Pingala</h2>
<p>Ida and Pingala crisscross at each chakra, forming a <strong>double helix pattern</strong> reminiscent of DNA. Their interplay determines our physical, mental, and emotional states:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Balance</strong>: When Ida and Pingala are balanced, energy flows freely through Sushumna, creating harmony and equilibrium in the body and mind.</li>
<li><strong>Breath Awareness</strong>: The nostrils provide a clue to which Nadi is dominant:</li>
<li>If the <strong>left nostril</strong> is more open, Ida is active.</li>
<li>If the <strong>right nostril</strong> is more open, Pingala is active.</li>
<li><strong>Nadi Shodhana (Alternate Nostril Breathing)</strong>: This yogic practice helps harmonize Ida and Pingala, promoting balance and activating Sushumna.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="awakening-sushumna">Awakening Sushumna</h2>
<p>Activating Sushumna Nadi requires sustained spiritual practice and discipline. Here are some methods that can help:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Meditation</strong>: Focusing on the breath or a specific chakra helps calm Ida and Pingala, paving the way for Sushumna activation.</li>
<li><strong>Pranayama</strong>: Breathing techniques like Nadi Shodhana or Kapalabhati help purify the Nadis.</li>
<li><strong>Asana Practice</strong>: Specific yoga poses, like spinal twists or inversions, enhance energy flow through the spine.</li>
<li><strong>Mantra Chanting</strong>: Reciting mantras like <strong>OM</strong> or <strong>So Hum</strong> aligns the mind and body, facilitating energy flow through Sushumna.</li>
<li><strong>Prana-Flow-Massage</strong>: A massage you will learn in this course, that I have invented to raise kundalini ernergy through swiping up the energy to the crown chakra.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="the-union-of-shiva-and-shakti">The Union of Shiva and Shakti</h2>
<p>When Ida and Pingala are balanced and energy flows through Sushumna, the union of <strong>Shiva</strong> (masculine consciousness) and <strong>Shakti</strong> (feminine energy) occurs. This union symbolizes enlightenment, where duality dissolves, and the practitioner experiences a state of <strong>oneness with the universe</strong>.</p>
<p>Later you will learn how to make a ritual with your partner, based on the Shiva and Shakti role play and the togetherness posture YabYum.</p>
<p>Understanding and working with the Nadis can profoundly enhance your spiritual practice, leading to greater balance, harmony, and ultimately, self-realization.</p>
<div style="margin-top: 20px;"></div>
<h2 id="kundalini">Kundalini</h2>
<p>The Coiled Energy of Transformation</p>
<p>Kundalini, often referred to as the <strong>serpent energy</strong>, is a dormant spiritual energy located at the base of the spine in the <strong>Muladhara Chakra</strong> (Root Chakra). In Sanskrit, <em>Kundalini</em> translates to <em>coiled one</em>, symbolizing the potential energy coiled like a serpent at the base of the spine, waiting to be awakened.</p>
<h3 id="the-nature-of-kundalini">The Nature of Kundalini</h3>
<p>Kundalini is the divine feminine energy or <strong>Shakti</strong> within us, representing the raw creative power of the universe. When awakened, it rises through the central channel (<strong>Sushumna Nadi</strong>) in the spine, activating the chakras and leading to heightened states of awareness, spiritual awakening, and ultimately, enlightenment.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Dormant State</strong>: In most people, Kundalini remains in a latent state, influencing life subtly through physical and mental energy.</li>
<li><strong>Awakened State</strong>: When awakened, Kundalini uncoils and ascends through the chakras, unlocking higher levels of consciousness.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-path-of-kundalini">The Path of Kundalini</h3>
<p>The path of Kundalini follows the three major Nadis:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Ida Nadi</strong>: Represents the feminine, cooling energy (moon).</li>
<li><strong>Pingala Nadi</strong>: Represents the masculine, heating energy (sun).</li>
<li><strong>Sushumna Nadi</strong>: The central pathway through which Kundalini rises when Ida and Pingala are balanced.</li>
</ol>
<p>As Kundalini ascends, it pierces through the seven chakras, clearing blockages and releasing energy. Each chakra’s awakening brings specific transformations in physical, emotional, and spiritual realms.</p>
<h3 id="awakening-kundalini">Awakening Kundalini</h3>
<p>Awakening Kundalini is a profound and often life-altering process. It requires preparation, discipline, and guidance to ensure safety and effectiveness.</p>
<h4 id="preparatory-practices">Preparatory Practices</h4>
<ol>
<li><strong>Asana (Physical Yoga)</strong>: Postures help purify the body and balance energy flow.</li>
<li><strong>Pranayama (Breathing Techniques)</strong>: Practices like Nadi Shodhana and Kapalabhati help cleanse the Nadis and prepare the body for Kundalini's rise.</li>
<li><strong>Meditation</strong>: Focused meditation on the chakras or mantra chanting directs energy inward.</li>
<li><strong>Mudras and Bandhas</strong>:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><strong>Mudras</strong>: Hand gestures like Gyan Mudra help channel energy.</li>
<li><strong>Bandhas</strong>: Energy locks like Mula Bandha (root lock) prevent energy leakage.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="5">
<li><strong>Self-Discipline</strong>: A balanced diet, abstention from harmful substances, and ethical living enhance energy purity.</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="techniques-for-awakening-kundalini">Techniques for Awakening Kundalini</h4>
<ol>
<li><strong>Kundalini Yoga</strong>: Combines dynamic poses, breathing, meditation, and chanting to stimulate Kundalini energy.</li>
<li><strong>Shaktipat</strong>: A spiritual transmission by a guru, where energy is awakened through touch, mantra, or intention.</li>
<li><strong>Meditation on the Chakras</strong>: Visualizing or focusing on the chakras allows Kundalini to rise through the Sushumna.</li>
<li><strong>Mantra Chanting</strong>: Repeating sacred sounds, like <strong>OM</strong> or <strong>Sat Nam</strong>, resonates with the Nadis and chakras.</li>
<li><strong>Prana-Flow-Massage</strong>: This massage, which I have invented, based on the full body orgasm massage which I have learned from Somanada Moses Maimon, will help you to clean chakras, nadis and to bring the energy up your spine.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="experiences-during-kundalini-awakening">Experiences During Kundalini Awakening</h3>
<p>As Kundalini rises, practitioners may experience physical, emotional, and spiritual sensations. These vary widely and may include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Physical</strong>:</li>
<li>Heat or tingling sensations along the spine.</li>
<li>Involuntary body movements (Kriyas).</li>
<li>Enhanced vitality or temporary fatigue.</li>
<li><strong>Emotional</strong>:</li>
<li>Release of suppressed emotions.</li>
<li>Deep feelings of love, bliss, or oneness.</li>
<li><strong>Spiritual</strong>:</li>
<li>Heightened awareness and intuition.</li>
<li>Profound insights or mystical experiences.</li>
<li>A sense of connection with the universe.</li>
</ul>
<p>I personally had such Kriyas while I was at the dentist a few days ago, extracting one tooth.</p>
<p>Also a full kundalini rising I had during an anal massage workshop. I think there my last blockage has been released in my anal area.
I was floating between the earth and the sky. And I needed someone from outside to ground me and pull me back into reality, because my partner has been to toilett while I was floating.
So keep in mind...<strong>DON'T LEAVE YOUR PARTNER ALONE</strong> until he/she is coming back to earth.</p>
<h3 id="benefits-of-kundalini-awakening">Benefits of Kundalini Awakening</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Spiritual Growth</strong>: Awakening Kundalini leads to expanded consciousness and spiritual enlightenment.</li>
<li><strong>Healing</strong>: Blockages in the chakras and nadis are cleared, promoting emotional and physical well-being.</li>
<li><strong>Creativity</strong>: As the energy flows freely, creative potential is unleashed.</li>
<li><strong>Inner Transformation</strong>: Old patterns and fears dissolve, leading to a more authentic and empowered self.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="cautions-and-challenges">Cautions and Challenges</h3>
<p>While Kundalini awakening is transformative, it can also be intense or overwhelming if undertaken prematurely or without guidance.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Symptoms of Imbalance</strong>:</li>
<li>Anxiety, restlessness, or insomnia.</li>
<li>Physical discomfort or energy surges.</li>
<li>Emotional instability or confusion.</li>
<li><strong>Need for Guidance</strong>:</li>
<li>It’s essential to seek the guidance of a qualified teacher or spiritual mentor.</li>
<li>Avoid forcing or rushing the process; patience and preparation are key.</li>
<li>You are able to stop energy flowing closing the left nostril.</li>
<li>Also when I had my first full body orgasm I was not able to sleep for 3 nights. I rang up one of my tantric teachers, a doctor in medicine, and she told me that I could lead the energy to the soil standing barefoot on the ground to get rid of this much energy. She also said that I might use this energy and night time to make something creative. I started to write books.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-goal-of-kundalini-awakening">The Goal of Kundalini Awakening</h3>
<p>The ultimate purpose of Kundalini awakening is to achieve <strong>self-realization</strong> and <strong>spiritual enlightenment</strong>. As the energy rises and unites with the <strong>Sahasrara Chakra</strong> (Crown Chakra), one transcends duality, experiencing oneness with the universe and the divine.</p>
<p>Awakening Kundalini is not just a physical or energetic process; it is a journey of transformation that unfolds the highest potential of human consciousness.</p>
