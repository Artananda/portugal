<h2 id="introduction-work-in-progress">Introduction (work in progress)</h2>
<p>This online course is all about tantric sexuality, the chakra system, kundalini, prana, and how it all works together.
When we grow up, nobody tells us how to live a healthy sexuality. Nobody introduces us to tantra or Buddhism—not in kindergarten, not in school. We have to find out on our own. At least, that was my experience. In school, they only teach us about how to avoid pregnancy, but that's it.
So, what did we do? We consumed some lectures, like those from <em>BRAVO</em>, where we could read a bit more about sexuality.</p>
<p>Nowadays, our children can easily access porn.
While pornography is not inherently negative, it often presents a limited and sometimes harmful perspective on sexuality. As a yogi, I am totally against violence. In <em>Ahimsa</em>, a foundational concept in yoga, it is emphasized that violence is harmful and should be avoided at any cost.</p>
<p>In a world where intimacy is often replaced by screen consumption, it is more important than ever to discover authentic and healing ways to experience sexuality.</p>
<p>In this course, you will learn how to channel your energy through breathing techniques and simple exercises, how to apply conscious touch, and how to build a deeper connection with your partner.</p>

<h2 id="who-i-am">Who I Am</h2>
<p>After I quit my regular job in 2014 at a bank in Zurich following a burnout, I began taking Shiatsu sessions. I wanted to do something similar because I really enjoyed this type of treatment.
However, since Shiatsu doesn't involve treating the whole body, I went on to study tantra massage in Lucerne with Jacqueline Schönbächler, a student of Andro.
Andro introduced tantra massage to Europe 45 years ago.</p>
<p>At this very massage workshop, my heart opened, and I experienced my first full-body orgasm—or should I say ecstasy. No matter what words I use, they can only diminish the magnitude of what I truly experienced.
I laughed, I cried, I felt that we are all one. And I remained in this state for about fifteen minutes. I wasn’t aware that men could also have this experience. I had only heard of it from a handful of women.
From that day on, I wanted to explore more.</p>
<p>I later went to Copenhagen in Denmark to receive training in <strong>Full Body Orgasm Massage</strong> from Somananda Moses Maimon and participated in many tantric workshops at the Diamond Lotus Tantra Massage Institute in Berlin. I even created their website, which allowed me to attend all their workshops with my girlfriend.</p>
<p>Additionally, I studied <strong>Sexological Bodywork</strong> in Zurich with Didi Liebold and Janine Hug.</p>
<div style="margin-top: 20px;"></div>
<h2 id="my-mission">My Mission</h2>
<p>After discovering that men can also achieve this kind of orgasm without ejaculation, I made it my mission to share this knowledge with every man on the planet.
I also overcame erectile dysfunction in my 50s within half a year, and I can now help other men facing similar challenges. These men can still make love with women. I will teach techniques in the Slow Sex section and show how giving a massage can be an alternative.</p>
<p>I am also one of the men who consumed porn and visited prostitutes. This experience has given me insight into what men really need—and what they don’t.</p>
<p>I aim to change the narrative as much as I can. We don’t need so much unhealthy, harmful porn, and we don’t need cheap sexual encounters. What men truly need is something else—like a hug. Sometimes, we just want to feel loved by someone, especially if we didn’t receive enough love from our parents as children. Everything was conditional: ‘If you do your homework, I’ll love you,’ or ‘If you clean your room, I’ll love you.’ This is conditioning, not love.</p>

<h2 id="for-whom-this-workshop-is">For Whom This Workshop Is</h2>
<p>This workshop is for all human beings who have completed puberty. However, in some locations, there may be legal restrictions.
A good piece of advice is to let teenagers discover sexuality on their own. But if our children are inclined to learn from porn, I would prefer they study this course instead.</p>
<p>This course can also be beneficial for older people, as techniques like Slow Sex can help cultivate a healthy and fulfilling sexuality.</p>
<p>Sexuality—or more specifically, the rising of energy—is incredibly beneficial. There’s even a song from the Rainbow community that goes like this: '<em>Every little cell in my body is happy, every little cell in my body is well. I'm so glad, every little cell in my body is happy and well.</em>'</p>
<div style="margin-top: 20px;"></div>
<h2 id="for-whom-this-workshop-isnt">For Whom This Workshop Isn’t</h2>
<p>As mentioned earlier, it’s not intended for teenagers.
This workshop may not be suitable for people who hold firmly to traditional relationship ideals or find it difficult to embrace new ideas. However, I invite you to approach this with an open mind and consider whether this knowledge could enrich your life.
It’s not for those who are closed to new ideas or for people who rely solely on doctors for healing instead of exploring self-healing methods.
While this course focuses on heterosexual dynamics, many of the techniques can be utilized by individuals of all orientations and identities to elevate their energy.</p>
<div style="margin-top: 20px;"></div>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>This course is a journey toward healthy and fulfilling sexuality, connecting your body, mind, and energy. Wherever you are on your journey, these tools have the potential to enrich your life.</p>
